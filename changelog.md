### Release Highlights
This is the first version of code for sensorless field oriented control of PMSM using PLL estimator, integrated with Power Factor Correction on MCHV-230VAC-1.5kW Development Board [(EV78U65A)](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ev78u65a) with dsPIC33AK128MC106 MC DIM [(EV68M17A)](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ev68m17a).

The firmware is set up for running Leadshine 400W 220VAC Servo Motor(EL5-M0400-1-24 : AC300025).
This motor was tested under no load conditions. To achieve optimal performance under loaded conditions, the control parameters in the firmware may need additional tuning.
